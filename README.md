## Hi there 🙋🏽‍♀️

My name is Dialid and I am a mathematician working as a finance quantitative analyst. I was born in [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City) and grew up in [Oaxaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca), Mexico. In 2012, I moved to the UK to study a PhD in Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/). Currently, I work for an investment bank in London.

I am currently:

- 🔭  working as front office quantitative strategist
- 🖥 coding in C++ and Python
- 📚 reading: I am currently reading The Last Lecture, Prisoner of Geography, and Capital Ideas.
- 📺 watching: I just finished the last season of [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) and not watching anything at the moment. If you have a good tv-series recommendation please let me know!
