<h2 align="center">Hello world 🗺️✨ I'm Dialid </h2>

I am a mathematician working as a Quantitative Analyst at an investment bank in London. In my free time, I create open source projects and write about financial mathematics, programming, statistics, data visualisation, and other related topics.

Project Updates:

- 🗓️ Moved my Advent Calendars to their own repos:
