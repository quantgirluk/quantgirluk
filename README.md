My name is Dialid and I am a mathematician working as a quantitative analyst at an investment bank in London. In my free time, I create open source projects and write about financial mathematics, programming, statistics, data visualisation, and other related topics

I am currently:

- 🔭 working as front office quantitative strategist
- 🖥 coding in Python using Pycharm and VSCode
- 📚 reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) and [Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/179198.Capital_Ideas)
- 📺 not watching anything at the moment. If you have a good tv-series, film, or documentary recommendation please let me know!
