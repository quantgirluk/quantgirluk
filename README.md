- 🖥 coding mainly in Python 🐍 using both Pycharm and VSCode
- ✨ writing this series of notes about topics in Financial Mathematics: [UQF: Understanding Quantitative Finance](https://quantgirluk.github.io/Understanding-Quantitative-Finance/intro.html)
- 📚 reading [The Perfection Trap](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/447202/the-perfection-trap-by-curran-thomas/9781847943866) and [Invisible Women](https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/)
- 📺 not watching anything at the moment. If you have a good tv-series, film, or documentary recommendation please let me know!
